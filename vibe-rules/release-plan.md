# Rule: Writing a Release Plan

## Goal

Prepare a clear plan for an upcoming release (e.g. v0.1, v1.0), including scope, tasks, testing, and release criteria.

## When to Use

When preparing for a milestone or public version.

## Process

1. **Define Version and Deadline**: Name the release (e.g., v1.0) and target date.
2. **Scope Features**: List PRDs and task files that must be completed.
3. **Test Criteria**: Define what must be tested or reviewed.
4. **Release Checklist**:
   - QA complete
   - Regression tests
   - Changelog
   - Version bump
   - Deployment verified
5. **Fallback Plan**: Note what can be cut/delayed.
